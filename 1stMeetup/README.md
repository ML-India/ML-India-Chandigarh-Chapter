## Abstract

Glad to announce the first meetup of the ML India - Chandigarh chapter on 6th May, 2017 at 11AM - 1:30PM (Saturday). Read more about ML India here [link](http://ml-india.org/).


Here are the abstract of the proceedings::

Brief discussion on a paper -  'A Machine Learning Approach to Twitter User Classification' by Marco Pennacchiotti and Ana-Maria Popescu [Link](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/view/2886/3262), which talks about detecting user's political affiliation, ethnicity and affinity for a particular business using rich linguistic features on user's behaviour, with an application to Twitter.


The discussion will be followed up by a hands-on session on sentiment analysis of tweets. For instance, we will analyse what twitterati feels about our political leaders like Arvind Kejriwal and Narendra Modi. The idea of the hands-on is to get you started with a basic problem in data science. Post this session, you will be able to fetch tweets from twitter, being them into your ipython notebook and play with it.

Please bring your laptops to participate in the hands-on session.

We will cover following in the hands-on

* Quick intro to python and ipython-notebook  
* Small intro to twitter-API and setting up credentials  
* Fetching tweets for different political leaders  
* Basic intro to sentiment analysis  
* Analyse the results of sentiment analysis  
* Your home-work for next hands-on

Here are some pre-requisites of this session

* A working twitter account  
* Download and install Anaconda [link]  
* Basic familiarity with iPython [link] and Python [link]

But if you are not familiar with these, worry not!
